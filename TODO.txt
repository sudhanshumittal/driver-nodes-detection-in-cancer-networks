MATLAB
option of elitism
=============================================================
parameters = 
crossover prob
mutation prob
population 100 
generations 500-1000
=============================================================
initial population totally random

repeat 100 times	
	tournament selection (
	randomly pick two indiviuals and choose the better one parent 1
	(eliminate tehe used individuals) repeat for parent 2)/ ranking selection operator / 
	perform crossover (see performance with single point crossover crossover probaibilty 0.6- 0.8)
	generate 2 children 
pointwise mutation/ bitwise mutation  (flip every bit of every child with mutation probab 1/length of string)-
combine parent and children (200) - called intermediate children
select best 100 people

save the best, average fitness value for every generation
