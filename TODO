objective
to get connected components of flip-graph

step 1. ****DONE****
get connected components from flip-only graph
(basically which node is in which connected component)

step2. *****DONE*****
also find the set of isolated nodes in flip-only graph. these are basically connected components of size one.

step3. *****DONE*****
create connections between CC's flip-graph using the CC's of flip-only and isolated nodes.
 
step4.	*****DONE*****
find flips for each connected component of flip-graph
 
step5. 
Use matlab's existing library for finding the minflip solution
